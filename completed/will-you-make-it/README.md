 - Description:
You were camping with your friends far away from home, but when it's time to go back, you realize that your fuel is running out and the nearest pump is `50` miles away! You know that on average, your car runs on about `25` miles per gallon. There are `2` gallons left. 

Considering these factors, write a function that tells you if it is possible to get to the pump or not.

```if-not:prolog,nasm,cobol
Function should return `true` if it is possible and `false` if not.
```

```if:prolog,nasm,cobol
Function should return `1` if it is possible and `0` if not.
```
